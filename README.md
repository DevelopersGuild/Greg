Space Abandoned VR

A Federation Cruiser was just on a routine patrol through the Dao-29 System, but on the far moon of Birtola-9, a faint distress signal was detected. After establishing radio contact, the source of the signal was identified as Professor Konn Rhinemann, the leader of a lunar expeditionary team investigating an abandoned moon base.

His whole team is dead, and he is running out of oxygen.

You are RST-528, and you have been tasked with establishing contact with Professor Rhinemann, and returning him to the ship alive and well.
