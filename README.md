# Greg
Space Abandoned VR

While on a routine patrol passing through the Dao-29 System, the F.S.S. Damien Grey detected a faint signal on the far side of Birtola-9. After closing in on the source, the signal was identified as Private Golgo "Greg" Mukayama, chief technical officer of a lunar expeditionary team investigating an abandoned moon base.

A rogue lieutenant commissioned the expedition, but the fool led them into a trap.

Now everyone is dead, killed by a rogue AI they call "P.A.L.".

You are a Federation Recon Scout Trooper tasked with finding Greg, and bringing him back to the ship in one piece.
