# Greg
Space Abandoned VR

A Federation Cruiser was just on a routine patrol through the Dao-29 System, but on the far moon of Birtola-9, a faint distress signal was detected. After establishing radio contact, the source of the signal was identified as Greg Yamamoto, the technician of a lunar expeditionary team investigating an abandoned moon base.

They were led down there by a foolish lieutenant who had gone AWOL.

Now everyone is dead, killed by a rogue AI they call "PAL-9001".

You are RST-528, a Federation Terrestrial Recon Scout Trooper. Your job is to establish contact with Greg, and return him to the ship alive and well.
